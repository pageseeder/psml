longDescription = """
The PageSeeder Markup Language (PSML) API provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with PSML documents.
PSML is an XML-based markup language specifically designed for structured content management in the PageSeeder platform.

This library enables developers to create, parse, manipulate, and transform PSML documents programmatically
in Java applications. It offers seamless conversion between PSML and other popular formats including HTML and Markdown.

Key features include:
- Full support for PSML document structure and semantics
- Robust XML parsing and serialization
- Bidirectional conversion with HTML and Markdown
- Document validation against PSML schemas
- Support for PSML fragments and sections
- Utilities for extracting and manipulating document metadata
- Integration with the PageSeeder platform's content management capabilities

The PSML API is designed for both standalone use and as part of PageSeeder-based content management solutions. It
follows best practices for XML processing while providing a developer-friendly interface to handle structured documents
efficiently.

Maintained by Allette Systems since 2016, this library is part of the PageSeeder ecosystem for managing structured
content in enterprise applications.
